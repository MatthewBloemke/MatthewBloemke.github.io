                            I had heard it over and over. From friends and family alike. Dating apps don’t work. 
                            People are only on them for hookups. Most of me believed that. 
                            There was no way I would find the woman I am meant to marry on a dating app. 
                            Regardless, I went against everything I heard and created a profile. 
                            Soon after, I had a date setup with a very pretty girl in Henderson Minnesota. 
                            I packed a picnic lunch, got some flowers, a nice outfit, and set out. It was the best first date I could’ve asked for. 
                            I had asked many friends for input on my outfit, fancy cologne, flowers, etc. I could not have been more nervous. 
                            All those nerves melted away immediately. It was so easy to talk to her! We walked around a town with a population of 1000 for 6 hours straight. 
                            Every date after lasted 10+ hours. I got the feeling very early that she was something special. 
                            Fast forward two weeks, and she has agreed to be known as my girlfriend. (Ask us how I asked, it was as smooth as I’ll be for the rest of my life). 
                            It’s so hard to remember all the details in order, time just seemed to fly by. 
                            Every single day she showed me yet another reason why she is the most wonderful woman on the planet.
